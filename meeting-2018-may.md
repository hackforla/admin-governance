  * Merch designs
  
## Nina

* **Project Frameworks**
  * Tamura and I met on May 4 to further develop ideas on the project framework.  Notes here.  Notes from a prior meeting with detailed framework descriptions + visuals here.
  * Tamura turned the action items from the meeting notes into project cards.  Now we just need to prioritize, assign, and do the things.  :)
  * Let’s get this piloted on our new projects groups.  We’ve got a few to choose from - Street Tree Map, Spare.  Let’s start with paper if we need to so we can get it rolling.
* **Code for California**
  * Merge with existing “California Civic Lab”, which was already established between Code for Sacramento, Code for San Francisco, Code for San Jose, Open Oakland, and Open San Diego - http://caciviclab.org/
  * **Potential projects:**
    * Send Open Data Pledge to CA Senator & Governor candidates for this year's elections.  See Chi Hack Night's work: https://chihacknight.org/events/2018/02/13/kim-foxx.html
  * **Existing CA Civic Lab projects:**
    * Open Disclosure (visualize campaign finance data in local elections)
    * State Agency Inventory (status of state agencies’ open data)
* **Brigade Action Teams (BATs)** - brings together multiple brigades to collaborate on a project
  * **IDEA** - Toolkit for brigades to be Inclusive, Diversive, Equitable, and Accessible.  Plans to submit their proposal in time to launch at Summit.
  * **Street Quality Index** - Patrick Atwater wants to crowdsource street imagery (via OpenStreetCam) and run ARGO’s analysis on them to determine street quality.
  * **Matchmaking/Project Framework** - The idea has been floating around for creating a set of standardized project frameworks that brigades can use.  This coincides conveniently with our recent discussions about our HFLA project groups.  While there’s a lot of support for the idea, someone needs to step up to be the champion for this as a BAT project.
* **Code for America Summit**
  * **Details** for Brigade attendees here: http://c4a.me/summit
    * Anthony/Josh/Wes - if you haven't already RSVP'd for Brigade Day, [do that here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfJTtdIzEhxL9oaM9qA3VJWMAzQ9w1N_yh5h_TINHkO0bTtpg/viewform?usp=sf_link). Sign up for [Summit Buddies here](https://www.notion.so/Summit-Buddies-c03712a5724c45058e58d0956afd0d71) to start making friends with people from other brigades.
    * Have any of you signed up to do a lightning talk?!  I’m going to try to come up with something.
  * **Tuesday** - NAC is meeting and then having dinner at Jen Palkha’s house.  Open Oakland is opening up their hack night to all brigade attendees.
  * **Wednesday** - Brigade Day.  RSVP here if you haven’t already.  Check out the schedule of events.  We close out the night with a happy hour social for all brigade members.
  * **Thursday & Friday** - the Summit.
    * I’ll be on a panel about “How Brigade-Government Relationships are Renewing Civic Infrastructure”.
    * There will be a **Brigade Lounge** area for brigade members to hang out at and for people interested in the brigade program to find out more.  I’m thinking of bringing a civic crafting project.
  * **Saturday** - CFA is hosting breakfast for brigades at their San Francisco office.
* **Other things**
  * Website redesign - Should we ressurect the project group to roll out the multiple things in the pipeline? https://github.com/hackforla/website-redesign/issues
  * Blogger volunteer - I haven't followed up with the volunteer yet.

## Hack Nights

* **DTLA - Josh & Tamura**
  * Project Updates
  * Spare - [Nina] I met someone at the civic tech happy hour who works closely with Skid Row non-profits and orgs.  I invited him to come to our hack nights and work with this group as a subject matter expert.
  * Clean Air LA - new project started last week
  * Needs?
* **Santa Monica - Wes & Kegan**
  * Project Updates
  * Needs?
* **South LA - Nina & Tamura**
  * Pick a launch date?

## Upcoming Events

* Demo Day (July) - do our hack night leads want to push for this to happen?  We need to let the project groups know so they can prepare.  Before that, we need to decide what we want from them.  I’d say a condensed version of the Civic Tech Canvas, no wireframes/mockups/MVPs necessary.  

## Other

* Big Data Day - call for proposals open now.
* Workshop Planning
* SCALE - Open Data Day / Brigade Event
* CFA Fellowship Partners - start scoping out ideas and talk to government folks for next year.
* Data + Donuts fall training seminar - volunteers (Sep/Oct)
